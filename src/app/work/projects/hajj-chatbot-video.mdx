## Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end content-creation automation built with n8n and Airtable. The workflow orchestrates LLMs, data storage, and publishing tools to produce scalable long-form content.

## Key Features

- n8n workflows that orchestrate prompts, LLM calls, and post-processing
- Airtable as the CMS: structured content records, editorial status, and scheduling
- Automated publishing (email campaigns, platform posting) and Airtable-driven templates
- Built-in quality checks and fallback steps to ensure content consistency and safety

## Outcomes

- Reduced manual content production time by 80% through automation
- Scalable pipeline for newsletter and long-form article generation
- Integration-ready connectors for Airtable, email providers, and storage
